\title{Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient}
\usage{
bcophenetic(proximity_matrix, hclust_obj, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{proximity_matrix}{A square matrix of proximities (either similarities or dissimilarities).}

\item{hclust_obj}{An hclust object from hierarchical clustering.}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the type of proximity measure;
"similarities" or "dissimilarities" (can be abbreviated to "sim" or "diss").
This parameter is required with no default to ensure explicit specification.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value: the cophenetic correlation coefficient.
Higher values (closer to 1) indicate that the dendrogram structure
better preserves the original proximity relationships.
}
\description{
Calculate the cophenetic correlation coefficient for a hierarchical clustering.
This measures how faithfully the dendrogram preserves the pairwise distances
between the original observations.
}
\details{
The cophenetic correlation is calculated between:
\itemize{
\item The original proximity matrix (lower triangle)
\item The cophenetic distances from the dendrogram (lower triangle)
}

For dissimilarity data, a positive correlation is expected (small distances
cluster together). For similarity data, the correlation is negated so that
higher values always indicate better fit.
}
\examples{
# Create a distance matrix
dist_mat <- as.matrix(dist(iris[,1:4]))

# Perform hierarchical clustering
hc <- hclust(as.dist(dist_mat))

# Calculate cophenetic correlation
bcophenetic(dist_mat, hc, type = "diss")
