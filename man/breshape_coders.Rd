\title{Reshape Coder Matrices to Code Matrices}
\usage{
breshape_coders(..., coder_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Matrices where rows are documents and columns are codes.
Each matrix represents one coder's ratings. All matrices must have
the same dimensions.}

\item{coder_names}{Optional character vector of coder names. If NULL,
uses the names of the arguments or generates names like "Coder1", "Coder2", etc.}
}
\value{
A named list of matrices, one per code. Each matrix has documents
as rows and coders as columns. The list is given class "breshape_coders"
for pretty printing.
}
\description{
Takes multiple coder matrices (documents × codes) and reshapes them into
a list of code matrices (documents × coders), suitable for inter-rater
reliability analysis with \code{\link{bkappa}}.
}
\examples{
# Three coders rating 5 documents on 3 codes
alice <- matrix(c(1,1,0,1,0, 0,1,1,0,1, 1,0,0,1,1), nrow=5, ncol=3,
                dimnames=list(paste0("Doc",1:5), c("Theme1","Theme2","Theme3")))
bob   <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,0, 0,1,1,0,1, 1,1,0,1,1), nrow=5, ncol=3,
                dimnames=list(paste0("Doc",1:5), c("Theme1","Theme2","Theme3")))
carol <- matrix(c(1,0,0,1,0, 0,1,1,1,1, 1,0,0,1,0), nrow=5, ncol=3,
                dimnames=list(paste0("Doc",1:5), c("Theme1","Theme2","Theme3")))
