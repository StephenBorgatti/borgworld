\title{Create an Enhanced Biplot from a BPCA Object}
\usage{
bpcabiplot(
  bpca_obj,
  scale_factor = 1.5,
  label_offset = 1.15,
  point_col = "steelblue",
  arrow_col = "red",
  label_col = "darkred",
  point_cex = 1,
  label_cex = 0.8,
  main = "PCA Biplot",
  show_grid = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bpca_obj}{An object of class "bpca" produced by either the borgworld
\code{bpca()} function or the original bpca package}

\item{scale_factor}{Numeric. Scaling factor for variable arrows to improve
visibility. Default is 1.5}

\item{label_offset}{Numeric. Multiplicative offset for label positions from
arrow tips to reduce overlap. Default is 1.15}

\item{point_col}{Color for observation points. Default is "steelblue"}

\item{arrow_col}{Color for variable arrows. Default is "red"}

\item{label_col}{Color for variable labels. Default is "darkred"}

\item{point_cex}{Numeric. Size of observation points. Default is 1}

\item{label_cex}{Numeric. Size of variable labels. Default is 0.8}

\item{main}{Character string. Main title for the plot. Default is "PCA Biplot"}

\item{show_grid}{Logical. Whether to display grid lines. Default is TRUE}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to \code{plot()}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing:
\item{scores}{Matrix of PC scores for observations (first 2 PCs)}
\item{loadings}{Matrix of scaled loadings for variables}
\item{var_names}{Character vector of variable names}
}
\description{
Produces a biplot visualization from a \code{bpca} object with improved label
placement and customization options. The biplot displays both observations
(as points) and variables (as arrows) in the same plot using the first two
principal components.
}
\details{
The function extracts PC scores and loadings from the bpca object and creates
a biplot with the following features:
\itemize{
\item Smart label positioning based on quadrant to minimize overlap
\item Adjustable arrow scaling for better visibility
\item Percentage of variance explained shown on axis labels
\item Optional grid lines and legend
\item Customizable colors and sizes for all plot elements
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# For borgworld bpca:
data(iris)
p <- bpca(iris[,1:4])
bpcabiplot(p)

# Customized biplot with longer arrows and smaller labels
bpcabiplot(p,
           scale_factor = 2,
           label_cex = 0.7,
           point_col = "blue",
           arrow_col = "darkgreen")

# Without grid and custom title
bpcabiplot(p,
           show_grid = FALSE,
           main = "Iris Dataset PCA Biplot")
}
