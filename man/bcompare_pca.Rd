\title{Compare borgworld PCA with R's Native Functions}
\usage{
bcompare_pca(result, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{An object of class \code{bpca} from \code{\link{bpca}}}

\item{data}{The original data matrix or data frame used in the PCA}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing the comparison results.
The function is primarily called for its side effect of printing
a detailed comparison to the console.
}
\description{
Compares the results from \code{bpca} with R's built-in
PCA functions to demonstrate the differences in terminology and scaling
conventions between statistical computing and social science software.
}
\details{
This function demonstrates how to convert between R's PCA conventions
and social science conventions:

\itemize{
\item R's \code{prcomp} returns eigenvectors as "rotation"
\item Social science "loadings" = R's rotation * sqrt(eigenvalues)
\item R's scores have variance = eigenvalue
\item Standardized scores = R's scores / sqrt(eigenvalue)
}
}
\examples{
# Create example data
set.seed(123)
data <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 5), nrow = 100, ncol = 5)

# Run borgworld PCA
result <- bpca(data, n_components = 3)

# Compare with R's native functions
bcompare_pca(result, data)
