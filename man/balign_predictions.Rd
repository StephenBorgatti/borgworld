\title{Align predictions with original data rows}
\usage{
balign_predictions(original_data, cleaned_data, predictions)

balign_predictions(original_data, cleaned_data, predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_data}{Original data frame before cleaning}

\item{cleaned_data}{Cleaned data frame after removing missing values}

\item{predictions}{Vector of predictions from model fit on cleaned data}
}
\value{
Vector of predictions with same length as original_data, with NAs in removed positions

Vector of predictions with same length as original_data, with NAs in removed positions
}
\description{
Internal utility function to align predictions from cleaned data back to original data,
inserting NAs where rows were removed during cleaning.

Internal utility function to align predictions from cleaned data back to original data,

\details{
NOTE: This helper function is defined but not currently used.
The alignment is now done directly using kept_rows indices.
